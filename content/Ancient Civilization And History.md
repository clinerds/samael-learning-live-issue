## The Silurian Hypothesis

[[The Silurian Hypothesis]] challenges the notion that humans are the first advanced civilization on Earth. While our existence leaves signs in the environment, evidence of our civilization's existence will eventually fade away. Many past civilizations, such as ancient Egypt, have risen and fallen, leaving only sparse remnants behind. The Silurian Hypothesis suggests that complex life has existed for hundreds of millions of years, allowing enough time for other intelligent species to evolve, thrive, and go extinct. However, detecting the existence of ancient civilizations is challenging due to geological processes and the limited fossil record.

## The Sumerian Epic  ~ The Twelfth Planet(Part 2)

[[The Sumerian Epic  ~ The Twelfth Planet (Part 2)]] delves into the legend of Tiamat and Marduk, a celestial battle between deities in our solar system's early history. Zecharia Sitchin, a young boy fascinated by the Nephilim question, deciphered Sumerian tablets to uncover a myth potentially describing real events. He proposed a theory popularized in his book "The 12th Planet," suggesting the existence of a missing planet named Nibiru. This planet's alleged interactions caused significant changes in the solar system, explaining anomalies such as the asteroid belt, Uranus's tilt, and the moon's formation. While Sitchin's theory faces criticism, it remains a fascinating exploration of ancient myths and scientific possibilities.
